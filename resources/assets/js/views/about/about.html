    <p>
        I'm a Web Developer. I create competitive websites, and analyze web systems based on your requirements.
        I modify, redesign (layout/codes/database), and beautify websites passionately with the use of my skills.
        I let my hands get dirty on coding, specifically on the backend side.
    </p>

    <p>I also know Java programming. In fact, I used Java (J2EE) in my Capstone Project during college.</p>

    <p>I'm a happy, curious, and motivated person. Also, a good problem solver.</p>
