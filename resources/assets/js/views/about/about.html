    <p>
        I'm a Web Developer. I create competitive websites, and analyze web systems based on your requirements.
        I modify, redesign (layout/codes/database), and beautify websites passionately with the use of my skills.
        I let my hands get dirty on coding, specifically on the backend side.
    </p>

    <p>I usually do my projects with preparation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze specifications given by client.</li>
        <li>Confirm specifications to client.</li>
        <li>If there will be changes, change as desired. Otherwise, continue to next step.</li>
        <li>Design the layout. Repeat 3rd step.</li>
        <li>Start coding.</li>
        <li>Deploy the project.</li>
        <li>Client is happy with the project. I will be, too.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm a happy, curious, and motivated person. I get attention to details. Also, a good team player and a good problem solver.</p>
